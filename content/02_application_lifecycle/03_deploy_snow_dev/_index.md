## Deploying a ServiceNow Developer Instance

The purpose of this exercise is to take advantage of the Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) you
just deployed to kick off Ansible Jobs (tied to prehook or posthook tasks in the application
lifecycle of ACM.

A **pre hook** will kick off an Ansible job before the application creation / modification.
A **post hook** will kick off an Ansible job after the application creation / modification.

In the following example the Ansible job will trigger the creation of ServiceNow Change
Requests. Perform this step if you would like to show or learn how this integration works. You
will take advantage of this within the application lifecycle engine.

To deploy your own instance of ServiceNow, please visit https://developer.servicenow.com
Select **Sign up and Start Building**
