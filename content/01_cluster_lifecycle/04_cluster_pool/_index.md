## Cluster Pools

### What is a Cluster Pool?

Cluster pools provide rapid and cost-effective access to configured Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on-demand and at scale. 

These pools can be claimed when needed and can help to create or replace clusters in a matter of minutes.

ClusterClaim resources are used, which automatically assign running or hibernating clusters based on availability.
